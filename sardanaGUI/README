1. How to compile
-----------------
1.0 prerequisites: 
  - java 1.5 (java.sun.com), 
  - Ant Tool (ant.apache.org)
    -> Only necessary if you plan to build a new JAR binary file
    Note: Ant already ships with eclipse so if you are compiling from eclipse 
    you won't need to install Ant
 
1.1 The SVN repository already contains a lib directory which contains all 
necessary JAR files to compile and run SardanaGUI

1.2 Building (optional): run % ant (either from the command line or through your 
favorite IDE)

----------------
2. How to run
----------------
1.1 Change to the directory were sardana script is located and simply write in 
the command line:

% ./sardana [ pool filter] [ alternative <TangoHost>:<TangoPort> ] 

  if [pool filter] is not given it defaults to '.*'. 

  In the optional pool filter parameter you can write a regular expression that
  will match against all pool devices that exist in the database. E.x.: If in the
  Database the following pool devices have been registered:
    ctalpha/pool/01
    ctbeta/pool/01
    ctgama/pool/01
    ctgama/pool/02
  but you know in advance that you only want to work with pools on ctgama you can
  type in the command line:
  % ./sardana ctgama.*
  
  if no alternative database is given, the one in the environment variable
  TANGO_HOST will be used.

----------------
3. How to distribute
----------------
The files/directories necessary to run SardanaGUI are:

sardana.jar
lib/
res/

if you place all this in a zip file your distribution is done!
