1 Installation

  This chapter describes the necessary steps for a MacroServer compilation

  all <install dir> references below refer to the desired installation directory.

  The following instructions describe the necessary steps for installing the
  entire Pool system including some generic controllers.
  If you don't need to install the pool and just want to install the controllers
  please follow the instructions under ctrls/README.

1.1 Prerequisites

  - PyTango >= 3.0.4
  - SPS - the shared memory library from Grenoble. This is optional package if
          you want the shared memory features and actually not necessary to 
          install the MacroServer.

1.2 install
  
  Go to the MacroServer root directory and type:

  % mkdir build
  % cd build
  % ../configure
    
    - if not system installation provide: 
        --prefix=<install dir>
    
    - if using an alternative python distribution provide:
        --with-python-prefix=<python root>
    
    - if you don't want to install the default macros that are provided by this
      distribution provide:
      --enable-extra-macros=no or
      --disable-extra-macros
      
  % make
  % sudo make install

2. Execution

  To configure and start a new MacroServer system please look into the 
  doc/ConfigUserGuide.lyx under section 7.

Appendix A: HKL library 
-----------------------

The HKL available from http://repo.or.cz/r/hkl.git.
It has been developed by the SOLEIL synchrotron.
The contact person is PICCA Frédéric-Emmanuel: frederic-emmanuel.picca .at. synchrotron-soleil.fr

To checkout and build (you need the 'git' tool and 'scons'):
 % git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/hkl.git
 % cd hkl
 % scons

In order to set a VALID HKL_ROOT (or --with-hkl-prefix) to build sardana, you 
need to make a symbolic link to the build result directory of hkl called 'lib'.
If you install the library on the system, the step above is, of course, 
unnecessary.

Example:
 - suppose you have checked out HKL into /home/bart/workspace
 - you are on linux with bash
 
 % cd hkl
 % scons
   (this will build scons in debug mode)
 % ln -s debug/linux2/src lib
 % export HKL_ROOT=/home/bart/workspace/hkl
