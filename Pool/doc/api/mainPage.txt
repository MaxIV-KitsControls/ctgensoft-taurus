@section abstract Abstract
This document describes the Device Pool Tango Device Server software API. This
is a <A HREF="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</A> automatically generated API 
document. It is especially intended for the Device Pool core developer.

@section introduction Introduction
The Device Pool is a software package designed to provide control over a set (pool)
of heterogeneous hardware devices such as motors and counters. It does this by
providing a common interface (the "Controller" interface) implemented through a
series of plugins that access the hardware directly or indirectly. \n
Although the Device Pool can run stand alone, it is actually just a part of a 
larger software package called Sardana. Besides the Device Pool, the Sardana system 
contains other components such as the 'Macro Server', a configuration GUI, a command
line interface (CLI) application called 'Spock' amongst others. \n

@section implementation Implementation
<P>
The Device Pool was designed to be a <A HREF="http://www.tango-controls.org">Tango</A> 
based device server.\n
At its core the Pool is entirely built in C++ in order to provide maximum 
performance. However, the Controller interface allows for the creation of 
plugins written in C++ or Python.
<P>
The device server must contain one and only one device of the class 'Pool' in 
order to be considered a 'Device Pool Tango device server'.
