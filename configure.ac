# -version-info CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]
# From the libtool documentation (info libtool)
# So, libtool library versions are described by three integers:

# CURRENT = The most recent interface number that this library implements.

# REVISION = The implementation number of the CURRENT interface.

# AGE = The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that this
#       library implements.  In other words, the library implements all the
#       interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT - AGE' to
#       `CURRENT'.
